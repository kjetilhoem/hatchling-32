# Hatchling 32

## Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to learn. I wish to learn, among other things, about programming Scala, by taking on a task which I know requires me to dive into a lot of detail. Something that requires me to get a whole lot of stuff completely right.

## Bitwise archaeology

Growing up in the 80s I learned to program BASIC on the Dragon 32 micro. Greatly fascinated by games and drawn by the opportunities for making my small experimental programs perform better by orders of magnitudes, as well as unlocking possibilities of the computer completely out of reach of a BASIC program, I went on to learn programming directly towards the CPU using assembler. 

30 years later as a software business professional, the raw low level realm of machine code has been long since abandoned. Realizing that to solve a particular problem in a piece of software I am so much better off trying to define it precisely and understandably first, often leaving raw performance as an interesting exercise in the end whenever it turns out to be necessary. In practice, my experience is that it only rarely is if you did everything else right.

However, the fascination lingers on for the low level bit fiddling.
