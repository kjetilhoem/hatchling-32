# Hatchling 32

DISCLAIMER: The code in this project is severely embryonic in nature and will only 
work in particular ways under certain conditions. The idea is to be plummeting down a single 
vertical as far as possible and bother with details at a later point.

## Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to learn. I wish to learn, among other things, about programming Scala, by taking on a task which I know requires me to dive into a lot of detail. Something that requires me to get a whole lot of stuff completely right.
